# clusteringtransients

This repository will contain clustering methods chosen by the creator to analyze large sums of pressure transient data. 

Method 1 : Agglomerative (Hierarchical)

Method 2 : K-means (Centroid based)

Method 3 : DBSCAN (Density based)

Method 4 : Gaussian (Distribution based)

Method 5 : Fuzzy clustering 

For each method there is a seperate script that is then used by a data handling module and then a plotting module to output the data using the method selected.

Additionally, there will be a file handling module to accesss the large sums of data and extract it into useful pieces.
